  Hi! I'm Funda, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.
  
  Originally from Samsun, I attended Ali Fuat Basgil Anatolian High School.

<p>Currently, I'm pursuing Software Engineering at Mugla University, where I hope to build on my foundation in Web and App Development.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting to know me a bit. I'm looking forward to what lies ahead and connecting with others who share similar interests!</p>
